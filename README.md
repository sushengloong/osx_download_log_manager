OSX Download Log Manager
=========================
Mac OS X keeps a running log of all your file downloads in a local sqlite3 database (see http://lifehacker.com/your-mac-logs-everything-you-download-heres-how-to-cle-1658394180 for more information).

This Ruby web app is simply a web frontend for the OSX download log database.
